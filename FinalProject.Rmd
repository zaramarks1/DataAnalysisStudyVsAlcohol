## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
data<-read.csv("Maths.csv")
library(lattice)
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Histogram 

We will do some histograms to have a better understanding of the data used. 

```{r}

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

#Histogram of Petal Width with 10 bins
hist(data$G1,
          main="Grade First Semerter",
          xlab="Grade")

hist(data$G2,
          main="Grade Second Semerter",
          xlab="Grade")

hist(data$absences,
          main="Absenses of students",
          xlab="Nb of Absence")

hist(data$absences,
          main="Age",
          xlab="Age")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Barplot

Since we have a lot of columns with defined variables, it is interesting to make some barplots so we can get a better uderstanding of the dataset.

### Barplots related to studying

```{r}

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

barplot(table(data$higher),  main="Students who wants to get a higher education")
barplot(table(data$studytime), main = "Amount of study time")
barplot(table(data$activities), main = "Extra-curricular activities")
barplot(table(data$paid), main = "Paid courses")

```

### Barplots related to drinking

```{r}

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
barplot(table(data$freetime),  main="Amount of free time")
barplot(table(data$goout), main = "Going out with friends")
barplot(table(data$Dalc), main = "Workday alcohol consumption")
barplot(table(data$Walc), main = "Weekend alcohol consumption")

```

## Boxplots 

Now that we undertand our dataset a little bit, we will do some boxplots to analyze is some of our data have outliers and/or if the values are spread out or not.


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

boxplot(data$absences, main = "Absences")
boxplot(data$age, main = "Age")
```

## Histogram with overlay

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = G3)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = paid), bins = 30, color = "black") 




```

## Other graphs with overlay

```{r}

plot(data$age, data$Walc, main="Scatterplot Example",
   xlab="Age ", ylab="Weekend alcohol", pch=19)

ggplot(data, aes(x = studytime, y = Walc)) +
  geom_count(alpha = 0.5)
```
